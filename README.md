# Read The Color 
## A Jetpack Compose Game

## Introduction
There are all kinds of brainteasers that test our perception and swiftness of mind. The latest? A game created by UK-based lens retailer Lenstore that tests what's called the Stroop effect.

According to Scientific American, the Stroop effect proves that if the name of a color is presented in a color that doesn't match, it can affect how quickly a person is able to name the color they're actually seeing.

"For example," it says, "if the word 'red' is printed in yellow ink it will take a different amount of time for a person to name the color of the ink than if the word 'red' is printed in red ink."
